The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use it with units that are not compatible, it can lead to unexpected behavior.  For example, using `calc(100% - 5px)` is fine, but `calc(100% - 5em)` might not work as expected if `em` is relative to a parent element with different font-size.  Another issue might be forgetting spaces between operators and operands in `calc()`, which leads to unexpected errors. For example, `calc(100%-5px)` is invalid; correct is `calc(100% - 5px)`.
